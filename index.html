        <p>
            Hello! I’m Matheesha Fernando,
            I’m from Moratuwa with a keen interest in technology
            and software development.Born on March 29, 2004,
            I’m currently a student learning Software Engineering,
            where I’m building a strong foundation in programming,
            algorithms, and modern development techniques.As
            I continue my studies, my goal is to learn and grow
            into a skilled software developer.I’m excited about working
            on real-world projects, collaborating with others, and making
            a positive impact in the world of technology.

        <p>
            After my Advanced Level examination,
            I aspire to become a software engineer. To achieve this goal,
            I have decided to enroll in the GDSE (Graduate Diploma in Software Engineering)
            program at the IJSE institute.The GDSE program offers comprehensive training in
            software development, including programming languages, software design, database
            management, and project development. I believe this program will provide me with
            the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the field of software engineering.
